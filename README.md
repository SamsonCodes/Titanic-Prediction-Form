# Titanic-Prediction-Form
This is a Web App in Flask that allows you to get survival predictions for Titanic passenger data through a form UI. I made this model so that time travellers can use it to decide whether or not to board the Titanic when travelling back to 1912.

Just kidding. I made it to practice my Developer and Machine Learning skills. The model used was trained by myself and there is some data preprocessing taking place behind the scenes for the sake of model performance. 

Simply fill in the data in accordance to the instructions and press predict to learn your fate.
